# This is a project simply for testing and experimenting with some code in C, with and without the standard library.
Feel free to take a look, but don't copy my code unless you have read and understood what
is does and how it does it. Even still,
I recommend typing it out so that you
can learn it better, and so you can keep
it in your own code formatting style.

If you copy my code and are using it in
any public and large scale and/or commercial
project, please give credit to me by giving
my GitHub Username and a link or reference to this repository.

If you are copying code from this cheat in
Atlas/Holberton School, shame on you. Otherwise,
please feel free to take a look and maybe learn
from it if you can, though I don't really expect
anyone to take a look at this.
